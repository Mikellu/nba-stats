        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The users of this application would be fantasy basketball players and the sports betting community. 
            In addition, scouts can also use our application for some comparison functions. 
            The information the users would be viewing are the real life stats of each NBA player, 
            and I will be using a real life nba stats api to keep our stats updated, 
            and these are the links to the external source: 
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/">API</a> &
            <a href="https://www.lineups.com/nba/player-stats">Example</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul> Some iteractions our application would have:
                <li>filters playerâ€™s data to show only guards, forwards, or center</li>
                <li>
                    sorts players with different stats in order, 
                    such as showing players who have the most points per game on the top of the page
                </li>
                <li>
                    a trading comparison tool using a bar graph for fantasy players where it shows 
                    which categories the user is gaining and losing with the players the user selects to trade.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
