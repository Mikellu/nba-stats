    <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
    <img src="img/naruto.png" alt="Naruto Uzumaki">
    <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the protagonist of the famous manga series, 
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a></cite>.
        On the day of his birth, Naruto became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails — 
        a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. 
        After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement while chasing his dream to become Hokage. 
        In the following years, through many challenges and trainings, Naruto became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, 
        and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf Village. 
        He soon led the Allied Shinobi Forces in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, 
        leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.
